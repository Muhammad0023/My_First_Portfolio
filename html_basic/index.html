    <h1>Muhammad Ali: The Greatest of All Time</h1>

    <h2>Early Life and Rise to Fame</h2>
    <p>
        Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history. He began boxing at the age of 12 after his bicycle was stolen, and he wanted to "whup" the thief. Under the guidance of police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, Ali quickly rose through the amateur ranks, winning the Golden Gloves title and an Olympic gold medal in 1960.

    <h2>Championship Career</h2>
    <p>
        Ali turned professional shortly after his Olympic victory and quickly became known for his speed, agility, and unorthodox fighting style. In 1964, he defeated Sonny Liston to become the heavyweight champion of the world at just 22 years old. His famous phrase, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," perfectly described his approach in the ring. Ali's career included legendary bouts like the "Fight of the Century" against Joe Frazier and the "Rumble in the Jungle" against George Foreman.

    <h3>Beyond Boxing: Activism and Legacy</h3>
    <p>
        Beyond his athletic achievements, Muhammad Ali was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement and a vocal advocate for social justice. He refused to be drafted into the Vietnam War due to his religious beliefs and opposition to the conflict, famously stating, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong." This stance cost him his boxing title and license, but he became a symbol of resistance and principle. Ali's legacy extends far beyond sports, inspiring millions around the world.

    <h3>Later Life and Impact</h3>
    <p>
        After retiring from boxing in 1981, Ali focused on philanthropy, humanitarian work, and raising awareness about Parkinson's disease, which he was diagnosed with in 1984. He lit the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, a powerful moment that showcased his enduring spirit. Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, but his impact as a sports icon, activist, and global ambassador for peace continues to resonate. He remains "The Greatest" in the hearts of many.
